I hate to break it to you, but it's just the other way around
You can thank your stars all you want
But I'll always be the lucky one
Tell me something
When I'm 'bout to lose control
How do you patiently hold my hand
And gently calm me down?

You can thank your stars all you want
But I'll always be the lucky one
Tell me something
When I'm 'bout to lose control
How do you patiently hold my hand
And gently calm me down?
Tell me something

Why do I always photograph
My heart flying way above the clouds?

Thousand words have said to you. Those words that we thought we're not brave enough to tell<br>
in chat or even in person. But i want to say, thank you for almost three years, and to many<br>
more years, Until forever. Well, remember those first week/months of us of being that close<br>

say right now, YOU ARE WORTH THE RISK. Di ko akalain na aabot tayo sa ganto. From those away,<br>
tagu-taguan daw pero pumunta na nagmeryenda, And yes it is me pasensya AHHAHA. To halos <br>

buhusan ng pagmamahal!<br>
<br>
Thank you for making me smile also everyday, i appreciate those time and even the simplest <br>
efforts from you, ramdam ko and for me those are special, i feel special. I fell to a girl <br>
that is beautiful, smart, kind, fun to be with, i just say that for me you are perfect.<br>
I did fell inlove not because kinilig lang, i fell inlove because of YOU mismo. I am soo <br>
proud of you, and even more proud to have you, Luna ko. i am glad to say these things to you,<br>
