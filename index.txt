With a golden summer smile?
Tell me something

To make everything alright?
I don't think that you even realize

I hate to break it to you, but it's just the other way around
You can thank your stars all you want
But I'll always be the lucky one
Tell me something
When I'm 'bout to lose control
How do you patiently hold my hand
And gently calm me down?
Tell me something
When you sing and when you laugh

Tell me something
When I'm feelin' tired and afraid
How do you know just what to say
To make everything alright?
I don't think that you even realize
The joy you make me feel when I'm inside your universe
You hold me like I'm the one who's precious
I hate to break it to you, but it's just the other way around
You can thank your stars all you want
But I'll always be the lucky one
Tell me something
When I'm 'bout to lose control
How do you patiently hold my hand
And gently calm me down?
Tell me something
When you sing and when you laugh
Why do I always photograph
My heart flying way above the clouds?

Thousand words have said to you. Those words that we thought we're not brave enough to tell<br>
in chat or even in person. But i want to say, thank you for almost three years, and to many<br>
more years, Until forever. Well, remember those first week/months of us of being that close<br>
again? Asaran lang naman dati but tumatak na lahat sa akin mga yon. Naging parte ka na rin <br>
ng araw ko, na araw-araw kang asarin. kadeyyy!<br>
<br>
it's been 2 years 9 months and 6 days since our path crossed again. Gosh naging crush ako ng<br>
crush kooo! Kabado talaga when i did confess my feelings to you. It was a risk, but all i can<br>
say right now, YOU ARE WORTH THE RISK. Di ko akalain na aabot tayo sa ganto. From those away,<br>
tagu-taguan daw pero pumunta na nagmeryenda, And yes it is me pasensya AHHAHA. To halos <br>
magpatayan us sa computer room dati. Sa refrigirator natin and many more memories!<br>
<br>
I know you thought before since nag uusap tayo again, "aabot pa ba kami ng isang taon?"<br>
But look at us rn, Ang sarap sa feeling na ganto na tayo. I love that i have saw how you grew<br>
as an individual, your confidence, our maturity. As your man, i always assure you those, more<br>
like di mo deserve na ma-down ka, and so i am always here for you since day 01. Ang sarap mo<br>
buhusan ng pagmamahal!<br>
<br>
Thank you for making me smile also everyday, i appreciate those time and even the simplest <br>
efforts from you, ramdam ko and for me those are special, i feel special. I fell to a girl <br>
that is beautiful, smart, kind, fun to be with, i just say that for me you are perfect.<br>
I did fell inlove not because kinilig lang, i fell inlove because of YOU mismo. I am soo <br>
proud of you, and even more proud to have you, Luna ko. i am glad to say these things to you,<br>
tamang ngiti lang habang nagt-type hahahha. Smile always! you have me no matter what,<br>
LOVE YOU SO MUCH, mahal ko. -SOL
